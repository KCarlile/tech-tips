# KCarlile's Tech Tips

_[Kenny Carlile's](https://github.com/KCarlile) personal collection of tech tips._

## Overview

This repo is a personal collection of tech tips to which I will be contributing over time. These are intended to be small snippets of code and notes that do not rise to the level of complexity and verbosity that would constitue a blog post. This is similar to a _Today I Learned (TIL)_ repo, like the one my friend [cander](https://github.com/cander) shared: [cander/til](https://github.com/cander/til)

## Index

- [JavaScript](javascript.md)
- [Jekyll](jekyll.md)
- [PHP](php.md)
- [Regular Expressions (RegEx)](regex.md)

## Usage
